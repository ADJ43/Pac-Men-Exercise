# Pac-Men-Exercise
Pac Men Exercise
In this project we worked in Javascript to manipulate objects in the DOM. It creates pacmen objecta and assign random position, direction and speed. It has boundaries and it will detect edges and bounce back.
To run this file you need to run index.html in a webserver.
Future improvements of this project will include different images of the pac-men to make it look more realistic and collision detection between objects.
